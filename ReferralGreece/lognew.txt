Coming here to update the html and so. Doing it proper for uploading on Git.

Will need some Javascript function that hides the dropdown onclick content brought from mobile size. Then I guess we
will have so they are shown again when it's resized. This shall be possible in CSS though, right? By the viewport.

Can put IDs on the dropdownclass and then hide the ID if there is some viewport size?

Gotta fix the issue with the sidenav, then I will upload it to Github and let any more processing be arbitrary.

Have fixed the issue now. It was simple as just making sure the responsive designed worked properly and hide
the display of dropdown content on bigger viewport and showing on smaller. Easy.

If I remember it correctly there shall be a symptom when a user is using smaller viewports that it keeps
the last clicked item as automatically hovered. I think it was something like that in this case that
turned the background of the dropdown red.

Since I can't test it currently I will just throw in come hovercolor white in the smaller viewports to
see if it works.

Update again: It shall already be fixed now as I see I have already set it responsive to only show on
bigger viewports.

Guess we are ready for Github and leave the rest of development arbitrary

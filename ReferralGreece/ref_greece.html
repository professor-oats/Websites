  <!-- Since codig without auto-completion: Make sure to check the "" marks -->
  <!-- Comments in <style> is made simply with /* */ or code is affected -->
  <!-- Comments in <script> are made simply with // or /* */, hence Javascript -->

  <!-- Far ahead in the future I will catergorise the elements with standard notation for SEO, Learn from WGR -->

  <!-- Always MOBILE FIRST (or atleast responsive huehuehuheu)-->
  <!-- Make sure to follow A11y -->

  <!-- 2021-07-02: Currently this landingpage has no breadcrumbs and no backpage function -->


  <!-- 2022-07-25: Coming back here with updates to tidy up some things in code
	   Currently the elements float over each other when resizing browser windows from small to big with the
	   sidenav elements active. Progress can be read in lognew.txt -->

  <!-- Quick notice: The scroll arrow is a corpse from an old idea. It's unused currently -->

  <!-- Update 2022-07-25: It's now fixed. No need for extra Javascripts and so. Just had to hide the dropdown when in bigger viewport and show it
       as block for lower viewports -->

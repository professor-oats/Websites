Gick igenom kodningen för bakgrundsbilden ej ville fästa korrekt på mobilversionerna.
Använde mig av view page source på FFC:s exempel och hittade där hur man kunde placera background-image
korrekt genom att först ge pseudo selectors för before och after på alla element på sidan och sätta dem som
box-sizing: border-box  så att det inte läggs massor av padding eller margins utanför elementen och därefter 
koda style för body::before så att de värdena appliceras först.

So today I pushed of fixing the height properties of the rolldown picture when submitting the form.
During this process I learnt about of how to declare and set CSS variables.
In the long run I never used the change to variables so I instead did a body.querySelector("#rollover");
in thanks to Felix Blaschke for this nifty great solution. 
 
It uses the transition property and changing the style accordingly to do a transform: "translateY(100%)";
What is more to be done is to make sure it is responsive on the viewports and just do some cosmetic finetuning,
checking against the FCC criterias to see if the assignment goes through and have it as a fun project to add some more things.

I would like to do a private hosting of this for the funz and I will dedicate this weekend into doing this.
One idea is to also add some music playing as the dropdown comes. Like the same delay as for the transition.
Will be fun.

During the week I will make sure the site is proper and by latest the weekend I will have a hosting without DNS ready.
However, there is a fallpit. The hosting environment I will be running on is Windows so I will either refresh the 
Dockering skills because the old Mac won't really suffice be on running.
I will look into Firewalling on Windows unless I want to drive it through the Mac but it will be better if it can be
turned of during the days. So I guess Windows firewalling it is.

Doing some quick tinkering to make it so the website passes for the FCC assignment.
Then I notice the rollover isn't following the viewport properly so will be fixing that one.
Since it's weekend I will now add all the functions that shall be on the website and then host it.

Weekend became busy with other things so only made it half way. I am compensating by putting time into it
during the week instead. I did the virtual environment in jail and fixed the Internet connection.
Got a simple localhost of Nginx up and I am looking through the NATing now.
Basically one of the jail aliases will be the external interface for the jail and then the FreeBSD host
will NAT the traffic onto it.

currently on this guide which have a good picture:
https://elatov.github.io/2011/05/freebsd-firewall-and-nat-with-pf/

At this point I set some easy aliases for the jail to make sure it connects properly.
However. For NATing to work the proper way I may have to use the loopback as a part of the
NAT.

2022-09-04
Today I am continuing in setting up the server and I start to realise that the current configuraton of network aliases won't work since nginx serves the content
on all ip-adresses at the same time since they are just aliases for each other ensuring to enable internet connection to the jail.
So I will either find a way to seperate the aliases as they are, if possible or I will put the jails on loopback and when needing multiple jails
I will alias the loopback addresses instead. In theory this is the way to do it and then I will NAT the traffic into the jails.

I also installed haproxy to see if this can help the serving of content in a good way.
Currently taking a crash course in NGINX to widen my knowledge of it to get more insight in the setup.

My bad, can be that I forgot that I run the nginx through chroot instead of in the jail itself HAHHAA
I will run it within jail under it's own user and test again
No wonder.

Had a break from things because had to spend time doing other necessary things. Updated the system and last log update from
09-04 can be disregarded I guess because the network aliases work as expected. I got a nginx up and running in the jail
and any computer on my local network can access the website. So I guess this is a great score.

What is need to be done now is to start migrating it so it will be accessible online as well. One of the more important
things is to make sure to block out martians and also put a somewhat ddos protection in the PF.

Will also make sure so there will only be access in the jailed environment.

Today's current productive/luck score = 0.8/3 = 0.26

As soon as I have the hosting ready I shall be able to make landing webpages easily
Then I can progress onto E-commerce

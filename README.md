Website I created as a landing page when I worked as Sales Agent for Customer's Service in Crete.
The company I worked for announced bonuses for personnel acting as 'referrers' to their recruiters.

This was originally done within two weeks on par with working full time. The original version was functional and worked well
apart from one visual issue where mobile users experienced red background to the text in the ulist content.

I used the landing page when marketing through Facebook to have people from any European countries apply through me so I would in turn
refer them directly to the recruiters. This was a very efficient way to do it until I mismarketed in a post on Facebook and got 
flagged as 'spam'/'untrusted'.

For this website I picked Namecheap as host providers to save development time, and also because of their cheap prices and great support.

As of now I revisited the 'code' and gave it proper touches. I kind of believe I fixed the visual issue at one point
and I also did some other tidying of functionally. I put an updated log about it and now it's a fully operational landing page
without any issues. There may be some Browser related compatibility uncalled for issues that still may are yet to be found.

Code is up-to-date modern and still have a lot of improvement for SEO when in want.
It shall be somewhat A11y compliant in its current form.

Working in Firefox and Microsoft Edge without issues.

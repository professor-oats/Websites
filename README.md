# Websites
Different websites made by me.

## How-to
To view them just update the path in the header of .html file and then open in your Browser.

## ReferralGreece
!!! Disclaimer: Comments in .css are kept from the learning and development stage. Porque perezoso. !!!

Website I created as a landing page when I worked as Sales Agent for Customer's Service in Crete.
The company I worked for announced bonuses for personnel acting as 'referrers' to their recruiters.

This was originally done within two weeks on par with working full time. The original version was functional and worked well
apart from one visual issue where mobile users experienced red background to the text in the ulist content.

I used the landing page when marketing through Facebook to have people from any European countries apply through me so I would in turn
refer them directly to the recruiters. This was a very efficient way to do it until I mismarketed in a post on Facebook and got 
flagged as 'spam'/'untrusted'.

For this website I picked Namecheap as host providers to save development time, and also because of their cheap prices and great support.

As of now I revisited the 'code' and gave it proper touches. I kind of believe I fixed the visual issue at one point
and I also did some other tidying of functionally. I put an updated log about it and now it's a fully operational landing page
without any issues. There may be some Browser related compatibility uncalled for issues that still may are yet to be found.

Code is up-to-date modern and still have a lot of improvement for SEO when in want.
It shall be somewhat A11y compliant in its current form.

Working in Firefox and Microsoft Edge without issues.

### What I learnt
As first functioning hosted website I learnt on how to do simple Javascripting to control the Dom and I learnt about hired hosting
environments, in this case Namecheap. As putting this up on Git much time later I have forgotten about the specific key challenges.
I started to learn about the importance of A11y and to keep websites 'clean coded' to up the SEO.


## Platanas
This is the current setup I use for testing purposes and it's a version of a form exercise on freeCodeCamp.

### What I learnt
Mainly using different hacks for CSS cosmetics and to make a roller to cover a website as well as switching background images on different conditions.
During the process I have also went through what it takes to do private hosting so have learnt the basics of nginx and to run it in one of my jails on FreeBSD
and updated so the website runs on a local network.

## LandingConnect
This is the exercise in creating a landing page with a navbar, a video and some pricing plan options under freeCodeCamp.

### What I learnt
Gotten better to structure website with sections. I also put all necessary elements wanted in a header - in the header, and I had some fun playing with the display:flex; styling and using a lot of percent-based spacing - which naturals responsiveness. Did some puzzling to get the transform properties done in JS and to have the transform being applied correctly.

Stable media queries and also made a conditional breakpoint for JS to change the habits depending on the viewport size.

I also learnt on how some elements fixed widths or heights can make it so the body stops occupying 100 % of viewport in favor/strictness related to the fixed widths or heights of children.

Overall the tidiest and most structured code so far.

New log here getting back to the project of the Tribute page of freeCodeCamp.
The old log is, I don't care at this point. The process is simply anyway.

Have done the whole structure and site so it will go pass through the tests.
Now we just have to do some fun and relaxing shenanigans to add flavor.
Go go go. Rotation.

ROTATION
To make the rotation of Bildt we want to add a layered picture so we will have like 8 or something.
Then we animate it to rotate through an axis and just to spin out when pressed on
"more christmas" too many times. Pog.

Have the number of pictures elements layered already with height 0 and then script to give them
100 %? Use the same overlap as I have done when adding beard and santa hat.

Position absolute for the layers?
